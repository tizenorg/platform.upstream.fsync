What is this about ?
********************

Flush a specific file to disk but not necessarily the whole disk and every disk on the system.

The point is that if you use the 'sync' it will schedule a flush for every disk on the system,
this can take a long time -- this allows you to flush just one file.
This allows you to just flush the data (ie not the metadata).

Why: if system service is interrupted at the wrong moment (eg crash or power fail)
what is in the filesystem on reboot might inconsistent. This is especially
true with files in the process of being updated; eg where a modified copy of a
file is created that is then renamed over the original.
Flushing blocks to disk can help to avoid problems.
This is a command line interface to the fsync(2) and fdatasync(2) system calls.
